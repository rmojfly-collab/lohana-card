# Lohana De Gracia – Toyota Contact Hub

This is a simple, mobile-friendly landing page you can host on **GitHub Pages**. It contains buttons for New/Used Inventory, Service scheduling, Social links, and Call/Text/Email.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)

1. Go to GitHub → create a **public** repository (e.g., `lohana-card`).
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, and upload everything from this folder (`index.html` and the `assets` folder).
3. Commit the changes.
4. Open **Settings → Pages**.
   - **Source:** `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch:** `main` (or `master`) and `/ (root)`
   - Click **Save**.
5. After a minute, your site will be live at:  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Customization

- Replace `assets/headshot.jpg` with your real headshot (same filename).
- Toyota logo is pulled from Wikipedia; you can swap it to a local file if desired.

- To add more buttons (e.g., model pages), edit the buttons in the HTML under the relevant `<section>`.

- Colors match Toyota red/black/white. Tweak in the CSS `:root` block.

## Optional

- Use a short link (e.g., bit.ly) and generate a QR code pointing to your GitHub Pages URL for texting/print materials.
- Add analytics with a privacy-friendly counter (e.g., Simple Analytics or Plausible) by inserting their script in `<head>`.
